# Equivalence

You can control how the value of a cell is compared to determine
if it needs to be updated by specifying an equality function.

!(./-snippets/equality.ts#equality)

If we update the cell with an equivalent value (according to the
`equals` function), the original object will remain in the cell.

!(./-snippets/equality.ts#update-with-equivalent)

If we update the cell with a non-equivalent value, the value will
update.

!(./-snippets/equality.ts#update-with-non-equivalent)

```md warning
This example using `Object.is` to demonstrate that the original
value is still in the cell.

In actual code, if you find yourself caring about the
**identity** of the value in the cell, you probably don't want to
use an `equals` function that causes objects with new identities
to be ignored.
