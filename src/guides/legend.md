# Stylistic Conventions

These guides try to incorporate secondary information with the
primary flow using labeled callouts.

If you follow the primary flow of the guides and skip the
callouts, you'll learn what you need to know. The callouts
provide additional information that you may be curious about.

Callouts use stylistic conventions to help you understand their
purpose and target audience.

## Sections Marked as "PROTIP" {.decor .protip}

Protip sections provide additional information that makes sense
in the normal flow of the guides, but the information isn't
strictly required to use Starbeam effectively.

The first time you read a particular guide, it's totally fine to
skip over protips if they're distracting, or if you're just not
interested in them.

## Callouts

```md tip Tips
Tips are provide information on Starbeam usage that are useful
for all Starbeam developers, but are not exactly related to the
primary documentation.
```

```md info Info
Info sections provide additional information about Starbeam's
programming model or philosophy. While tips provide actionable
usage information, info blocks help you understand Starbeam's
overall model. They are appropriate for all readers, but might be
distracting for you if you're a beginner still working on
becoming proficient enough to build something useful.
```

```md ðŸ’¡
Lightbulb sections provide interesting information about code
examples that are related to the primary topic, but which didn't
fit into the details of the specific code example.
```

```md details Details
Details sections go into more detail about the primary topic.
These sections may be distracting to first-time readers, but
should be helpful for those who already went through the primary
guides and are looking for more information and examples to help
solidify the concepts.
```

```md details type="deep-dive" title="Deep Dive Sections"
Deep dive sections dive deep into the philosophy or
implementation of Starbeam. They are most useful to readers with
a strong understanding of Starbeam and its usage, and are ready
for information to help build a deep understanding of Starbeam.
```
