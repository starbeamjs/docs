# Functions

Once you have some cells, you can compute values based on those
cells using normal functions.

![#simple-function](./-snippets/functions.ts)

And then use the function as normal.

![#use-as-normal](./-snippets/functions.ts)

You can also pass cells into functions as arguments.

![#cells-as-arguments](./-snippets/functions.ts)

And then use the function as normal.

![#use-cell-arguments-as-normal](./-snippets/functions.ts)
