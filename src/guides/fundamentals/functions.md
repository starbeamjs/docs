# Functions

Once you have some cells, you can compute values based on those
cells using normal functions.

```snippet {#simple-function}
<!--@include: ./-snippets/functions.ts-->
```

And then use the function as normal.

```snippet {#use-as-normal}
<!--@include: ./-snippets/functions.ts-->
```

You can also pass cells into functions as arguments.

```snippet {#cells-as-arguments}
<!--@include: ./-snippets/functions.ts-->
```

And then use the function as normal.

```snippet {#use-cell-arguments-as-normal}
<!--@include: ./-snippets/functions.ts-->
```
