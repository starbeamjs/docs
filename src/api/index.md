# The API Docs

This section contains the public API documentation for Starbeam.

```md construction
The API docs are under active development, and we're currently
focused on documenting lower level APIs that aren't directly
documented in the guides.

The best documentation on Starbeam's universal APIs is currently
[the universal guides].

The best documentation on framework renderers is currently in the
[frameworks] section.

[the universal guides]: /guides/index.md
[frameworks]: /frameworks/index.md
