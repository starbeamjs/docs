      The `Resource` function returns a `ResourceBlueprint`, which is an **unlinked** resource. You call `create()` on the blueprint with an owner to instantiate the resource and link its lifetime to the specified owner object.

  # Resources

  Resources are the main way to connect Starbeam to external input data.

  If you're used to using effects to connect external inputs in other frameworks, resources serve a
  similar purpose. The primary difference is that resources expose reactive data, just like
  `FormulaFn`.

  The author of a resource sets up an imperative subscription, defines the cleanup logic for the
  subscription, and returns a function that computes the current value of the resource.

  As the resource modifies its internal cells, the value of the resource is always up to date with the
  result of the computation.

  ```snippet {#resource}
  <!--@include: ./$snippets/resource.tsx-->
  ```

  Resources are defined in terms of Starbeam APIs, and then wired into applications through renderers.

  For example, you could use the stopwatch in the above example in React by using the `useResource`
  hook from `@starbeam/react`.

  ```snippet {#react}
  <!--@include: ./$snippets/resource.tsx-->
  ```
