# Getting Started with Preact

<script setup lang="ts">
  import * as resources from "./demos/resources/config.js";
</script>

<Demo :config="resources" />

Start by installing the Preact renderer into your app.

```npm
@starbeam/preact @starbeam/universal @starbeam/js
```

## Using Starbeam

!(./-snippets/quickstart.tsx#app)

This is the most basic way to use Starbeam in a Preact app.

## The `use` Hook

The `@starbeam/preact` renderer also includes a `use` hook, which
allows you to attach Starbeam resources into a Preact app.
Resources are instantiated when the component is mounted, and
cleaned up when the component is unmounted.

To get an idea for how it works, we'll integrate the Stopwatch
resource from the [Guides](/guides/fundamentals/resources)
section into Preact.

As a quick refresher, here's what the resource looks like:

!(./-snippets/resources.tsx#stopwatch)

The resource creates a cell that holds the current date, but
waits to set up the interval until the component that uses the
resource is mounted.

Once the component is **mounted**, the resource creates an timer
that will update the `time` cell once per second. It also
specifies a cleanup function that will run when the component
that uses the resource is **unmounted**.

Next, we'll use the `use` hook to integrate it into a Preact
component.

!(./-snippets/resources.tsx#component)

The `use` hook constructs the resource for us and integrates it
into the component's lifecycle. ==That's the magic of Starbeam
resources: they're written without any special knowledge of the
quirks of any particular framework, but they can be deeply
integrated into any framework.==
